        <dt> <b>MERN Stack :</b></dt>
        <dd>The MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack is a popular full-stack development stack used for building web applications. MongoDB is the database, Express.js is the backend framework, React is used for building the user interface, and Node.js is the runtime environment for server-side code.</dd>
      
        <dt><b>MEAN Stack :</b></dt>
        <dd>The MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack is another full-stack development stack. It uses MongoDB as the database, Express.js for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and Node.js as the runtime environment.</dd>
      
        <dt><b>LAMP Stack :</b></dt>
        <dd>The LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl) stack is a traditional full-stack development stack used for building dynamic web applications.

        <dt><b>Ruby on Rails :</b></dt>
        <dd>Ruby on Rails, often called Rails, is a full-stack web development framework that uses the Ruby programming language. It's known for its convention-over-configuration and developer-friendly features, making it ideal for building web applications with ease and speed.</dd>

        <dt><b>MEVN Stack :</b></dt>
        <dd>The MEVN (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js) stack is a JavaScript-based stack similar to MERN, but it uses Vue.js as the front-end framework. Vue.js is known for its simplicity and ease of integration, making it a great choice for building modern web applications.</dd>
